IP obtains the address and TCP guarantees delivery of data to that address
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection oriented, whereas UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connection-less.
The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer.
    Application Layer.
    Transport Layer.
    Internet Layer.
    Network Access Layer.


promiscuos mode  --- for wired connection ----- Sniffing the packets after connecting to an access point.
monitor mode    ----- for wireless connection-----Sniffing the packets in the air without connecting (associating) with any access point

options in wireshark =>> stop capturing packets

 filtering packets--          
                 a)  ip.addr == 192.68.1.101          =====>>> src or dst address is given ip address
                 b)  ip.src == access_point_ip_i.e_ethernet and ip.dst == ip_address_of_any_requeste_web_site   ===> filters packets with both given ip true
                 c) tcp     ===>> filters out all tcp packets
                 d) ip.addr == ip_address and tcp    ====> combining two types of filtering methods
                 e) tcp.port == 443    ===> gives https request
                 f) arp
                 
                 
                 
                 
 Right click on any packet and then go to follow and open tcp stream if pkt is tcp . u will see encryptedd or plain text of get / post request.
 
 
 
 
 click on any packet and go to bottom section div and right click on site and click on 'apply as a filter' and then click selected.
